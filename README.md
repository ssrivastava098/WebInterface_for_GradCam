Preferably create a virtual environment with earlier version of Python. I have used "Python 3.9.8". 

Steps to create virtual environment:-
  1. Download previous version of Python
  2. Go to your Project Folder. Open Terminal Window.
  3. Type "/path/to/your/python -m venv venv_for_gradcam_saliency_map"
  4. Activate your environment by "venv_for_gradcam_saliency_map\Scripts\activate"

After initializing your virtual environment download all the required packages mentioned in requirements.txt by "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Then run "python app.py"
